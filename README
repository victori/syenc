SYEnc
==========

SYEnc is a Scala decoder for the <a href="http://www.yenc.org/">yEnc format</a> that is based on Alex Russ's Java yEnc Decoder. SYEnc was designed to be used as a library by applications needing to use yEnc to decode data. It should be thread-safe, so don't worry about using it in a threaded context.
